Goldbach conjecture says that any positive an even integer can be in the form of a sum of two prime numbers, such as 28 + 5 = 23.

I must write a function goldbach-list (lower upper), which prints a list of all integers represented by the sum of two primes for a given range of integers.
Example:
  (Goldbach-list 20)
10 = 3 + 7
12 + 5 = 7
3 + 14 = 11
3 + 16 = 13
5 + 18 = 13
3 + 20 = 17
